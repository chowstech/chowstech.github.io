This is my personal website, if your a dev you should have one too!

## Development
This project is mainly just my hosting site. If you want information how to create a site using github as hosting see this link: XXXXX

If you really for some reason want to see the raw code for this site (which was done in Angular v10) go here: https://github.com/chowworks/chowworks-webpage
