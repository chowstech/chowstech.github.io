This is my personal website, if your a dev you should have one too!

## Development
This project is mainly just my hosting site. If you want information how to create a site using github as hosting see this link: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-host-your-angular-reactjs-vuejs-spa-on-github-pages-2d9ab102ac7b

If you really for some reason want to see the raw code for this site (which was done in Angular v10) go here: https://github.com/chowworks/chowworks-webpage 


## Contribute

If you see a bug or an issue report it here by creating a new issue.

Thank you for your help and improving my site, one issue at a time!
